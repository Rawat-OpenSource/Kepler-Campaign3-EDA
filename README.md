# Exoplanets 
Exoplanets are celestial bodies located outside our Solar system. These planets are not part of our own planetary system but generally revolve around other stars. As of May 1 2024, there are 5,638 confirmed exoplanets in 4,169 planetary systems, with 896 systems having more than a single planet revolving around it's sun[1](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). 
The count of confirmed exoplanets is in the thousands and rising, and it is expected to rise to the tens of thousands with the increase in observing power of robotic telescopes lofted into space.
